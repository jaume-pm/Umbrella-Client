    <h1>Welcome to Umbrella ☂️</h1>
    <p>Umbrella is a concerts platform where users can check out their favorite artists and make reservations for concerts. 🎶</p>
    <p>The key thing about this platform is that concerts with bad meteorological conditions have discounts, so users can get those tickets for a discounted price if they're willing to get wet. ☔</p>
    <p>At Umbrella, we believe that music should be enjoyed rain or shine, and we make it more affordable for you to do so! 🌦️</p>
    <p>All you'll need is an Umbrella! ☂️</p>
